1. The Fibonacci sequence is a sequence such that the next value is gotten by adding
the previous two values. Given that the 0th and 1st Fibonacci numbers are 0 and 1 
respectively, write a program that takes an input, n, and returns the nth Fibonacci 
number.

2. Write a program that finds the factorial of n.
n! = n x (n - 1) x (n - 2) x ... x 2 x 1

3. Write a program that finds the sum of all integers from 1 to an input number, n.
